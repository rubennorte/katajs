kata-js-boilerplate
===================

Boilerplate to use in JS Katas.

Includes:
* Jasmine
* Karma
* Phantomjs

To install the needed modules run: 
``npm install``

Once you have all the modules installed, in order to watch the files and start the kata run:

``node_modules/.bin/karma start karma2.conf.js``

If you have karma installed globally (which is highly recommended) you can run the next (shorter) command instead:

``karma start karma2.conf.js``
